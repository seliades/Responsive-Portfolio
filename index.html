      <h1>About Me</h1>

      <img src="assets/images/me.jpg" class="auth-image" alt="Stu Eliades">

      <p>I have spent the last 5 years as a Unit Manager for Capital One, managing a team of 15-20 phone agents and case workers. I have spent this time honing my leadership and influencing skills, and I am comfortable presenting in front of large groups. My management style is based on developing an enviornemt of trust where the team feels comfortable failing and learning from those failures. This gives my agents the comfort to experiment together and iterate quickly.</p>

      <p>I got into coding because people mangement has not tapped into my creative problem solving skills. I have really enjoyed having to think about my work in a totally different way, and I love the instant gratification of making a website or fixing an error. I can already see the difference in the way that I look at websites and try to break down how things are being done.</p>

      <p>In my free time I love hangin out with my wife and 3 kids. I'm a big sports fan, and I play a lot of fantasy sports. My wife and I enjoy binge watching Netflix, going to baseball games, and visitng aquariums. I'm a die hard Atlanta Braves, Liverpool FC, and Carolina Panthers fan.</p>
